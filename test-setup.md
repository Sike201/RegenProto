# Quick Test Setup

Your Solana Portfolio app is now running! 🎉

## 🔍 **Finding the Menu Bar Icon**

**Look in your macOS menu bar** (top-right corner of screen) for:
- A **small square icon** or **generic app icon**
- It should be near other system icons (WiFi, Battery, etc.)

## 🚀 **Quick Setup with Your API Key**

1. **Click the tray icon** in your menu bar
2. **Settings will open automatically** (first time)
3. **Enter this API key**: `b17fe4c2-e08d-49e1-976d-da902398191e`
4. **Add a Solana wallet address** to test (you can use a public one like `9WzDXwBbmkg8ZTbNMqUxvQRAyrZzDsGYdLVL9zYtAWWM`)
5. **Click "Save"**
6. **Your portfolio should load!**

## 🎯 **App Features to Test**

- **Single click tray**: Open/close portfolio window  
- **Right-click tray**: Context menu (Refresh, Settings, Quit)
- **Eye icon**: Hide/show balance amounts (privacy mode)
- **Refresh icon**: Manual portfolio refresh
- **Settings icon**: Manage wallets and preferences

## 📍 **If You Can't Find the Tray Icon**

The app is definitely running! If you can't see it:

1. **Check Activity Monitor** - Search for "Electron" processes
2. **Try clicking in different areas** of your menu bar
3. **Look for any new icons** that appeared recently
4. **The icon might be hidden** - try expanding collapsed menu bar items

## 🛠 **Test Wallet Address**

For testing, you can use this public Solana wallet:
`9WzDXwBbmkg8ZTbNMqUxvQRAyrZzDsGYdLVL9zYtAWWM`

This will show you how the portfolio display works with real data!
